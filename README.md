# hello-world
my first repository. I don't really know what to say here other than I am interested in learning Python and SQL for data analysis
I have been taking online SQL lessons on Udemy, w3 and mod and I am now taking a python lesson on data analysis. My goal is to learn enough to be able to work remotely from anywhere in the United States.
